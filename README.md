**Maternal Risk Classification Using Machine Learning: A Solution for Nigeria's Healthcare Crisis**  

In Nigeria, maternal mortality remains a critical public health challenge, with the country accounting for approximately 20% of global maternal deaths. Many of these deaths are preventable with early identification of risk factors and timely medical intervention. This project addresses this urgent problem through an AI-powered solution that classifies pregnancy risks using accessible health indicators.

The system analyzes six key parameters: maternal age, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, and heart rate. These metrics were selected based on their clinical relevance and ease of collection in low-resource settings. Using a Random Forest Classifier trained on authentic Nigerian health data, the model predicts risk levels with 89% accuracy, categorizing pregnancies into low, medium, or high-risk groups.

Technical implementation involved careful feature engineering and model optimization to ensure reliability in real-world scenarios. The algorithm was developed using Python's scikit-learn library, with particular attention to interpretability, a crucial factor for healthcare applications. The model's decision-making process can be visually explained through feature importance charts, helping medical professionals understand its predictions.

For deployment flexibility, the solution includes multiple interface options: a web application for clinics, an SMS-based system for rural areas, and an API for integration with existing health platforms. This multi-channel approach ensures accessibility across Nigeria's diverse healthcare infrastructure.

The project adheres to ethical AI principles by incorporating bias checks across demographic groups and maintaining strict data privacy standards. All predictions include the disclaimer that they should complement, not replace, professional medical judgment.

Looking ahead, i aim to partner with state health ministries to pilot this technology in primary healthcare centers. Future enhancements will incorporate local language support and integration with Nigeria's telemedicine initiatives. This open-source project invites collaboration from the global health and AI communities to refine and scale the solution.

By combining machine learning with appropriate healthcare delivery systems, this project demonstrates how technology can contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 3 - ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all at all ages.
